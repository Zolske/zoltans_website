        <h3>Modeling data</h3>
        <p class="expText">It is better to plan the structure (<i>schema</i>) of the data model before creating it.
            Especially "SQL" databases are harder to change after. This can be done with the help of an "<b>
                Entity-Relationship Diagram</b>".</p>
        <p>The general recommendation is to split the work into the following three design phases.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b><u>Conceptual:</u></b><br>the highest level phase where we map out the main entities, relationships,
                and attributes without a regard to storing them in the database yet.</li>
            <li><u><b>Logical:</b></u><br>in this phase, we decide which entities and relationships will actually be
                stored in a relational database, and associate each with a table, containing attributes as columns.</li>
            <li><u><b>Physical:</b></u><br>this is the lowest level phase in which we decide how exactly each of those
                tables should be stored in a computer.</li>
        </ol>
